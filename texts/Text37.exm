The PTI government's decision in December 2018 to impose a sin tax to enhance budgetary allocations for health has come as a pleasant surprise. If this plan is brought into effect, it will serve as a major step towards tuning up the country's financial system to the global development agenda. The Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (NHSRC) plans to impose this tax on tobacco and sugary drinks to generate funds to increase the health budget. The sin tax is not a standalone measure. It is part of a global development agenda. As per the National Health Vision 2016-2025, "federal and provincial governments will develop joint strategies to enhance resource mobilisation for health from official development assistance/international development partners, private-sector engagement, and taxes, such as [the] sin tax". A sin tax has two components. First, it seeks to reduce the consumption hazardous products that cause noncommunicable diseases. Second, once the tax has been collected, the government dedicates financial resources to fund health campaigns. To date, the government has restricted itself to the first stage. Now, it aims to bring about a major policy shift, which is quite complex. This complication was revealed during the last budget debate when the proposal for a 10 percent levy on tobacco products to generate funds for healthcare witnessed a stillbirth in parliament. The central debate focused on the legal implications of this measure – as it isn't a fiscal measure – and whether a special law needs to be passed by parliament to further this major policy measure. If the sin tax is imposed, it will align Pakistan with the growing international movements that dedicate funds received through taxes for development under international instruments like the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs), and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.

NCDs – mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes – are the main causes of death across the world. More than 36 million people die annually from NCDs (that's 63 percent of global deaths), including more than 14 million people who die too young between the ages of 30 and 70. Low- and middle-income countries already bear 86 percent of the burden of these premature deaths, resulting in cumulative economic losses of $7 trillion over the next 15 years and widespread poverty. In Pakistan, the NHSRC recognises that the common underlying factors for non-communicable diseases, including our lifestyle and nutrition, have not been addressed adequately. The country is ranked seventh-highest in the diabetes prevalence list. One-in-four adults over 18 years of age is hypertensive and smoking levels are high (38 percent among men and seven percent among women). Rising but still underestimated rates of cancer and cardiopulmonary disease remain largely ignored. The higher intake of fats, salt, sugar and smoking are the major factors that contribute to NCDs. The centuries-old sin tax is usually imposed on liquor and on tobacco in Western societies. Critics believe that it is legitimising sin. In Pakistan, under religious sanctions liquor and opium are criminalised and banned. Tobacco is taxed. There are multiple taxes on tobacco, such as the federal excise duty (FED), which the government of Pakistan claims has been levied to reduce tobacco consumption. Although there is no policy document to highlight this, this approach is mentioned in the budget speeches of successive finance ministers. In Pakistan, the rationale for FEDs is in sync with WHO recommendations: "effective tobacco taxes contribute significantly to state budgets. Increasing tobacco taxes generally further increases government revenues, as the increase in tax normally outweighs the decline in consumption of tobacco products". If the consumption tax in Pakistan did create a reduction in cigarette consumption, it has yet to be recorded. This tax needs to be linked to research evidence gather through the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (Gats), the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS), the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) and the Household Integrated Economic Survey. Official statistics reveal that more than 98 percent of FED collections are obtained from six major items in addition to cigarettes. Cigarettes constitute 33 percent of these collections. Around 26.2 percent of collections come through cement, 21.8% from services, 11 percent through beverages, 5.2 percent from natural gas, and 1.8 percent from edible oil. FEDs constitute 8.9 percent of indirect taxes and 5.5 percent of the federal taxes collected by the FBR. Collections from federal excise duties registered a growth of just four percent during 2017-18 as compared with collections made during the previous year. The net federal excise duties collected in 2017-18 stood at Rs205.9 billion as compared with Rs197.9 billion collected during the previous year. Collection from cigarettes amounted to Rs67.139 billion.
