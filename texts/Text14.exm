PARIS - A woman suicide bomber blew herself up in a police raid that foiled a plan to hit Paris' business district, days after attacks that killed 132 people across the French capital.
Police stormed an apartment in the Paris suburb of St Denis in a hunt for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian militant accused of masterminding the bombings and shootings, but more than 15 hours later it was still unclear if they had found him. Heavily armed officers entered the building before dawn, triggering a massive firefight and multiple explosions. Eight people were arrested and forensic scientists were working to confirm if two or three militants died in the violence.
"A new team of terrorists has been neutralised," Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters, saying police had fired 5,000 rounds of munitions into the apartment, which was left shredded by the assault, its windows blown out and the facade riddled with bullet impacts. "This commando could have become operational," Molins said. According to reports, preliminary investigation suggested that the dead woman might have been Abaaoud's cousin, while the Washington Post quoted senior intelligence officials as saying Abaaoud himself had died in the shootout.  Molins said none of the bodies had been identified, adding only that Abaaoud was not amongst those detained. 
Police were led to the apartment following a tip-off that the 28-year-old Belgian, previously thought to have orchestrated the Nov 13 attacks from Syria, was actually in France.
Investigators believe the attacks - the worst atrocity in France since World War Two - were set in motion in Syria, with militant cells in neighbouring Belgium organising the mayhem.
Local residents spoke of their fear and panic as the shooting started in St Denis just before 4.30 am (0330 GMT).  "We could see bullets flying and laser beams out of the window. There were explosions. You could feel the whole building shake," said Sabrine, a downstairs neighbour from the apartment that was raided. She told Europe 1 radio that she heard the people above her talking to each other, running around and reloading their guns.  Another local, Sanoko Abdulai, said that as the operation gathered pace, a young woman detonated an explosion. "She had a bomb, that's for sure. The police didn't kill her, she blew herself up...," he told Reuters, without giving details. Five police officers and a passerby were injured in the assault. A police dog was also killed.  The suspected mastermind of the Paris attacks, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was not among a number of people arrested in a huge police raid, the city's prosecutor said.
At least two bodies were found in the apartment in Saint-Denis, north of Paris, after a shootout with police, but they have not yet been identified, prosecutor Francois Molins told a press conference.
He said intelligence had led investigators to believe Abaaoud, a leading Islamic State extremist, could have been in the apartment. In a ferocious shootout, a woman detonated her suicide vest and a body was found riddled with bullets and was "not in a state that allows it to be identified", Molins said. Therefore, he said: "I am not able to give you a precise number and identity of those killed. There are at least two dead and verifications will likely take longer than expected" due to the state of the apartment building. According to Fox News, investigators would not publicly identify the second person killed in the raid, but The Washington Post, citing two senior European intelligence officials, reported that the suspected mastermind of Friday's horrific attacks was dead. The man believed to be the orchestrator of the massacre, 27-year-old Belgian ISIS militant Abdelhamid Abaaoud, had mocked Western authorities for his ability to slip out of their sights, into and out of Syria. Investigators traced him to an apartment in suburban Saint-Denis by tracking phone conversations and piecing together surveillance images and witness accounts. Highlighting US fears over the attack, two Air France flights bound for Paris from the United States were diverted Tuesday and landed safely after anonymous threats that the carrier described as a "bomb scare".  Meanwhile, A man arrested on Wednesday during a police assault on the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis told AFP he had loaned his apartment to two people from Belgium as a favour to a friend.  "A friend asked me to put up two of his friends for a few days," Jawad Bendaoud told AFP. The apartment was targeted by police hunting the mastermind of the Paris attacks last Friday. "I said that there was no mattress, they told me 'it's not a problem', they just wanted water and to pray," Bendaoud said before being handcuffed and led away by police. He said his friend told him the men came from Belgium, where according to investigators several of the jihadists were known to have lived.
"I was asked to do a favour, I did a favour. I didn't know they were terrorists."
