Despite the federal government`s opposition to a bill seeking to curtail powers of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the Senate`s standing committee on law and justice decided on Wednesday to obtain opinion of provincial governments on the proposed legislation. After hearing arguments of supporters and opponents of the bill, chairman of the committee Javed Abbasi said it would be too early to make a final decision and the committee would like to hear legal opinion of provincial law secretaries on it. Federal Law Secretary retired Justice Mohammad Raza Khan opposed the bill, saying it was repugnant to the constitution which gave supremacy to a federal law over any provincial legislation on the same subject. In this regard, he referred to Article 270-AA of the constitution. The bill, titled the `National Accountability (Amendment) Act 2015` and submitted by PPP`s Taj Haider during a Senate session on Nov 2, seeks to amend some sections of National Accountability Ordinance 1999 with an aim to restrict NAB`s jurisdiction to the federal departments and ministries.
Mr Haider said the 18th Amendment passed in 2010 provided for greater autonomy to the federating units and anti-corruption had now become a residuary subject. NAB`s jurisdiction should be restricted to 58 departments and ministries of the federal government. It was the responsibility of provinces to constitute their own autonomous accountability commissions or bureaus to conduct investigations into corruption in the provincial departments and ministries, he said. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has already formed the Ehtesab Commission. But Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement told the meeting that the constitution of theprovincial commission had been challenged in the Peshawar High Court. He advised the committee to wait for the court`s decision before deliberating on the proposed law. Mr Haider alleged that NAB had always been used as a tool to victimise political opponents. He gave the example of his party`s co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari, saying that he had been kept behind bars for 10 years though not a single charge could be proved against him.
The PPP senator questioned the ongoing drive against corruption in Sindh and said it had created the impression that corruption prevailed only in one province. However, the committee`s chairman said he would like to know who could give guarantee that provincial accountability bureaus would not be used for political purposes.

The committee members discussed in detail legal and technical aspects of the bill. Barrister Saif said Pakistan was required to meet international obligations on the issue and only the federal government, and not the provinces, could deal with the international community. Farooq Naek said the Federal Legislative List was silent on the issue of accountability and corruption, adding that the provinces had the right to enact laws to curb corruption in their departments. The bill`s statement of objectives and reasons says: `It is expedient that while the provincial accountability bureaus deal with the ceases within the respective provinces, NAB performs its duties more diligently in the departments of the federal government. The bill`s introduction says, `It is essential that all statutory organisations must act strictly within the parameters laid by the Constitution of Pakistan and there should be no transgression or interference in matters pertaining to the provinces.
