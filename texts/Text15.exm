A man in position loses his privacy. This saying fits well in the case of PTI Chairman Imran Khan whose quite personal and sad family episode has not only been toyed by the media in a rating race, but his adversaries in the politics also took it as a golden opportunity to make its optimum use with covet intent to demoralize him and his party near the second round of local government elections, forgetting how many skeletons existed in their own cupboards. Khan disdained the attitude of discussing his private life in the public and even rebuked media men and others on a few occasions. This may have schooled the media to an extent for paying respect to the privacy of others although it secured much of the fuel for its talk shows etc from the statements made by the estranged lady. The work of 'black magic,' behind their broken relationship, issue of dower money, divorce massage through SMS etc made crispy materials for the media reports and shows. Anyway things appear abating at one end, but the ordeal stays on the political side for Khan. The PML-N and PPP did not spare Khan, but Maulana Fazlur Rehman restrained his party men from commenting on this personal matter, asking them to pray for the comfort of Khan at this critical time of his life despite the fact that he was hardly spared by Imran in his public appearances. Khan's tirade against his rivals is on and he never stooped to slinging mud on their honour or poking into their personal life although there is no dearth of such stories against them too.
The top leadership of PML-N, particularly Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, did not exhibit indecency particularly against Imran Khan and avoided making any comment when the latter had bad time in his life. However, for other N-League leaders, Khan's episode is still a handy tool to bite him and demoralise his supporters. They include not only the ministers but people at the lower ranks in the party also have made a hobby to laugh at Khan by mentioning his broken marriage. One of the ministers said Khan had failed to sustain one marriage with a western woman and another with that from the east while another wanted the estranged lady to tell him address of the saint who worked black magic on Khan so that he could also contact him to make Khan act sanely.
The N-League criticises Imran Khan for his allegations regarding the general elections results and that of the recently held by-polls in NA-122, Lahore, as well as the local government polls in certain areas. He is known for his scathing tirade against the government during the dharna protest. In this background, the fury on the part of PML-N men is natural as their government is performing well and toeing positive policies for which it received public applause in the form of landslide victory in the LG polls. Yet treading that critical course, they need not to discuss the private life of a leader. If Khan demands correct voters' lists or questions the results, it is his legal right. And the law has to decide the things, not the politicians or the people.  From observers' point of view, Imran Khan, in a fit of emotions, spoke much against others, which he could have avoided easily. The observers say politics is a very serious and sensitive business and political leaders are those whose act and behavior determines fate of the nation and the country. They further say at the public level the people admire politicians, but their overreaction to the limits of indecency seldom gets approval by majority of them. So realising the seriousness and sensitivity of their responsibilities, they must shun frivolous talks.
