JUDGMENT

Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance and it stands for safety, security and sanctity of human life. Islam abhors unlawful killing of innocent people and strictly prohibits it in a number of Quranic verses and Ahadith. This aspect of the Islamic teachings, as well finds its reflection in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973. The Constitution, in its very Preamble, postulates that the principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by Islam, shall be fully observed and the fundamental rights, including equality of status, of opportunity and before the law, social, economic and political justice, and freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, worship and association, subject to law and public morality; shall be fully guaranteed. These very principles have been made a substantive part of the Constitution under Article 2A. Thus, it is the duty of the State to protect and safeguard all these Fundamental Rights including the right to life and liberty as envisaged by Article 9 of the Constitution.
In case of Arshad Mehmood v. Government of Punjab (PLD 2005 SC 193) also, the Court observed that the word 'life' used in Article 9 of the Constitution includes all such amenities and facilities which a person born in a free country is entitled to enjoy with dignity, legally and constitutionally. The word 'life' in the Constitution has not been used in a limited manner; a wide meaning should be given to enable a man not only to sustain life but to enjoy it. The State is duty bound to protect the life and property of its citizens in accordance with law against all the atrocities, target killings, homicide, etc. The basic human rights of life, liberty and enjoyment of one's property have been recognized nationally as well as internationally. Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that 'everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person', no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law; and all are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. 
Article 17 ibid lays down that 'everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others. It is worth mentioning here that no society can make any progress in a state of chaos and disorder. It is manifest to hypothesize that the law and order condition prevailing in a country has a direct and significant bearing on the pace and pattern of economic development of that country. The existence of basic socioeconomic framework of the country and the continuation of economic growth without any hindrance or interruption depends upon subsistence of better law and order situation. In case of break-down of peace on account of any factors negative effect is exerted on the economic growth. Better law and order as a determinant of economic development was spelled out in explicit terms in the theories of growth advanced by economists such as J.J Spangler and W. W. Rostow.
